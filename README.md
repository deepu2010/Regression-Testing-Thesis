# Thesis-Automated-Regression-Testing

I did a thesis on **Automated Regression Testing**, as part of my graduate course **CPSC 543 - Software Maintenance** guided by **Prof. James Choi**.

This thesis provides guidelines for implementing automated regression testing in an Agile environment. Regression Testing is a type of software testing used to find whether any new problems occur as a result of software changes. Before applying a change in a program, a program is first tested. After a change is applied, the program is retested in selected areas to determine whether the change has created new bugs or issues, or if the actual change has achieved itâ€™s the planned objective.

**Regression Testing:**
Regression Testing is one of the successful testing method which analyzes the impact of recent changes made to the existing features or new features of the software. Regression testing mainly checks whether the newly added features has modified the existing behavior of software. During regression testing we retest previous test cases to assure all the existing features are working as expected
